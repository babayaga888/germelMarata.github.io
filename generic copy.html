							<p>I am Germel John Marata, a computer science student at Cor Jesu College. As a computer science major, I am constantly learning and growing in my understanding of the field. My coursework includes a variety of topics, such as data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and software engineering. I find these subjects to be both challenging and rewarding, as they require me to think critically and creatively in order to solve problems.

								In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also involved in various extracurricular activities on campus. I enjoy participating in clubs and organizations that allow me to connect with other students and make the most of my college experience. I also enjoy spending my free time participating in hobbies and activities that I am passionate about, such as music, art, or volunteering.
								
								As I continue to progress through my computer science program, I am excited to have the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in practical settings. I am looking forward to participating in internships or co-op positions, as well as working on research projects or capstone projects. These experiences will not only help me to develop my professional skills and network, but also give me a taste of what it is like to work in the field of computer science.</p>
