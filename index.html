									<h3>Programming languages and web development</h3>
									<p>I have been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the past few years,
										 both in my personal projects and school projects. I have a strong foundation in HTML,
										  including an understanding of how to use tags and attributes to structure and format content.
										   I am also proficient in CSS, and am comfortable using various layout techniques,
										    including responsive design and flexbox. I have experience using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive websites, 
											including implementing event handling and AJAX requests.

										In addition to my web development skills, I also have experience with Java and Python.
										I have used Java in a variety of projects, including developing Android applications and working on back-end systems. 
										Python is my go-to language for data analysis and machine learning tasks. I have used it to work with large datasets,
										 build machine learning models, and create data visualizations. Overall,
										  I am confident in my ability to use a variety of programming languages to build and maintain effective software solutions..</p>

									<h3>Computer scientist</h3>
									<p>As a computer scientist, I am skilled at approaching problems in a logical and methodical way.
										 I begin by understanding the problem at hand and identifying the inputs and outputs that are required.
										  From there, I consider the different approaches that could be used to solve the problem, and evaluate their pros and cons.
										   Once I have chosen a solution, I implement it, testing and debugging as needed to ensure that it is correct and efficient.

										In addition to this systematic approach, I also have a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures, 
										which enables me to design and implement efficient solutions to complex problems.
										 I am comfortable working with large amounts of data, and have experience using various techniques for storing and manipulating data in an efficient way.
										  Overall, my problem-solving skills, combined with my technical expertise, allow me to effectively tackle a wide range of challenges as a computer scientist.</p>
